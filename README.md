# pyspark-intro-notebook

An introductory notebook for basic exploration of PySpark functionality. 

## Notebook

For the purposes of this notebook PySpark is used locally. 

Here we follow and summarise this [helpful introduction](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-introduction-to-pyspark-ff4284701873) to explore some basic PySpark operations including reading data, converting to pandas, and model fitting, and then additionally utilise [this post](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/10/30/introducing-vectorized-udfs-for-pyspark.html) for scaling pandas operations.

## Data

The nycflights13 dataset is commonly used in R for exploratory analysis. Here we also use data from NYC flights in 2013, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lampubhutia/nyc-flight-delay).
